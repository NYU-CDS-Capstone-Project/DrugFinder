# DrugFinder

## Project
The project is to establish the document analysis pipeline where given a list of targets of interest,  we improve our Named Entity Recognition (NER) to find drug-target pairs that we donâ€™t already have in our drug name dictionary from millions of medical papers.

Note: The instructor from Roivant (cooperative company) has asked me to limit the distribution of the electronic version of the capstone poster. So should you need the poster, please reach me out via email. Thanks for your understanding!
